# GBVIMS+ Resources
Beginning in 2013, the inter-agency GBVIMS Steering Committee, participated in the development of a new database, called Primero (GBVIMS +).  Primero is an open-source software system that will help partners securely and safely collect, store, manage, and share data on case management and incident monitoring.  The benefit of this new system is that it utilizes technology enhancements to manage individual cases and services (case management) for survivors as well as aggregate incident monitoring while also facilitating internal compilation.  The system also features heightened security, role-based access and viewing rights, and ways to accommodate different languages.

Primero is a partnership of UNICEF, IRC, Save the Children, UNFPA, DPKO and OSRSG-CAAC. For more information, visit primero.org.

Primero is the Protection Related Information Management System.  It is the umbrella platform (application) with several independent modules with functions for GBV and Child Protection.

GBVIMS+ is one module of Primero.  It is an enhancement of the current GBVIMS incident recorder with an added function for GBV case management.

The goal of the GBVIMS+ is a survivor-centered system. This system utilizes and will continue to take advantage of technology enhancements to manage individual cases and services for survivors as well as incident monitoring.  This includes:

- Ease of global updates, bug fixes
- Accommodate different languages (English, French, Arabic, Spanish)
- Ease of Compilation
- Heightened Security
  - Based in more secure framework (threat tests conducted)
  - Role-based access (increased emphasis on confidentiality)

Finally it is also a high priority for  GBVIMS+ to be able to accommodate different methods of data collection (computer, tablet); this enhancement is pending funding.
